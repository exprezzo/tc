automatically adapts to its environment.

ListView is an extension of jQuery Mobile ListView. Lists are used for data display, navigation,

read-only, linked, numbered, nested, collapsible lists and more. See jQuery Mobile’s ListView 
docs for more.

Move the code for calculating the tooltip's position from the constructor to the show method.  Fixed the issue

method. Fix bug: table header overlays on vertical bar.
Top table element width is not correctly synchronized with bottom table.

superpanel. Fixed bug: width of superpanel is not correct when wijgrid is empty.
The widht of superpanel should be the width of wijgrid outer div instead of 0

is not restored for fixedview.  Table element is wrapped in superpanel and 
should be restored to original place when destroying wijgrid.

Column only supports px width at present.

Modified flat view column width calculation algorithm to make width work for 
flat view.  This issue is reported by a user in github forum.  Width should
